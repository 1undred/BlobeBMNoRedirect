## Welcome to BlobeBM!
BlobeBM is an HTML program that runs bookmarklets in about:blank. Its very useful if bookmarklets dont work on your device or if they are blocked by your administrator.
#### How to use BlobeBM
First, make sure that you enable popups on the page for it to work! If an about:blank window opens, then it means you have enabled popups.

Where it says "Enter bookmarklet here", enter your bookmarklet.

It will then prompt you for how you want it to be called. I recommend naming it something that makes sense, because once you have a bunch of bookmarklets, you want it to be easy to tell which one's which.

Once you enter the name, you should see the bookmarklet show up. It consists of 4 buttons: The blue button is to run the bookmarklet, the remove button deletes the bookmarklet, and the other 2 buttons are to rename the bookmarklet and edit the bookmarklet itself.

You can add as many bookmarklets as you need on to BlobeBM. The bookmarklets will save even if you close the window or shut down your computer.

#### Enjoy!
